PROGRAM Runga_Kutta_second_order 
!Runga-Kutta second_order method produces more accurate data than Euler`s method by
!calculating the slope at the midpoint of the interval based o√Øf Euler`s approx-
!imation. This midpoint slope is then used to make a better extrapolation of the
!endpoint of the interval. It is interesting to see how energy is conserved between
!the two methods. Obviously, a simple harmonic oscillator is a conservative sys-
!tem, therefore, we should not get an increase or decrease of energy throughout
!it`s time-development. Energy is conserved in RK2 method.
